    "As evident from the comparative scoring above:\n",
    "- Logistic regression (ML model 1) has the best scores across all performance measures, and had the smallest difference between the train and test accuracy scores (less than 2%) as was in Part 4(a) of the project.\n",
    "- The Random Forest classifier (ML model 2) had the second-best scores across all performance measures, though its runtime was considerably higher than the others. Still, it was not as high to be considered impracticable for production deployment.\n",
    "- The multinomial Naive Bayes classifier (ML model 3) came out third in terms of the scores across all performance measures, though it was not far behind the second place at all. Its runtime was significantly higher than the second place's, too.\n",
    "- The Support Vector Machines (ML model 4), as discussed in Part 4(d) of the project, had extremely high runtime and not up-to-the-mark model performance, making it impracticable for this dataset and problem space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we can conclude that:\n",
    "- The **logistic regression** is the clear winner in the sentiment analysis for this project, in terms of both its performance measures and runtime.\n",
