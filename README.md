PROJECT STEAMBUZZ
-----------------
Using supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques, I have trained models to reliably predict gamersâ€™ response to future games and identify game elements to improve. This project was my Data Science degree's capstone project, containing the following:

(i) Jupyter Notebooks

(ii) Data files
---------------
Given the large of these files (about 3 gigabytes), they are uploaded on my Google Drive folder that is accessible to public (path: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-luzIfzgR8E-1Uped4bcc6XwHxXsEAtH?usp=sharing) \
